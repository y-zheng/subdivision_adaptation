R_simulations: simulation output from R. Each file is all time stages of one run. Five scenarios (m0G, m20G, m20L, m2G, m0.2G) each with 100 replicates.
SLiM_simulations: simulation output from SLiM. Each file is all time stages of TWO runs (one run of m0G and one run of m20L).

Scenario names (all sizes are haploid individuals):
m0G -> Panmictic with Ne = 20000
m20G -> Two demes each with Ne = 10000, migration rate is 20 per direction per generation, selection is global
m20L -> Two demes each with Ne = 10000, migration rate is 20 per direction per generation, selection is local in deme 1
m2G -> Two demes each with Ne = 10000, migration rate is 2 per direction per generation, selection is global
m0.2G -> Two demes each with Ne = 10000, migration rate is 0.2 per direction per generation, selection is global
